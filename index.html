            <h2>13-Year-old Boy Traded His Xbox and Worked So He Could Buy His Mom a Car</h2>
            <p class="date">May 15, 2019</p>
            
            <p>Not many 13-year-old boys can say that they were able to buy a car, let alone a car for their mother – but that is exactly what William Preston did last week.
             William’s mom, Krystal Preston, has been struggling to make ends meet since their family was forced to start over after an “unfortunate situation”.
             Since the single mother has been trying to provide for her three kids at their home in Fernley, Nevada, she has had no means of transportation – up until now.
             William was first inspired to give his mom a car after he spent some time watching videos of people giving cars to their mothers on Youtube. He later saw his 
             chance to make his dream a reality when he saw that a woman on Facebook was trying to sell her 1999 Toyota Metro for a cheap price.</p>

             <p>The teenager reached out to the woman and asked if she was willing to trade him the car for his Xbox, along with some money that he had earned from doing yard
             work and house cleaning for people in his community. At first, the woman was hesitant, but after some negotiating, she eventually accepted his offer and drove the 
             car over to William’s house.  When William told his mom that he had gotten a car for her, she did not believe him. He then led her out to the driveway where the Toyota
             was waiting for her – and she could not contain her emotions. “I lost it, I bawled so bad, I was just like, ‘There’s no way.’ What 13-year-old do you know buys their mom
             a car? I don’t know any, never heard of any,” Preston told KOLO. “I can’t even express it, like there’s no words that can express my gratitude and how proud I am.”</p>

              <h2>Charity Has Been Secretly Fulfilling Small Wishes for Homeless Kids</h2>
              <p class="date">May 15, 2019</p>
              
              <p>Homeless families struggling to make ends meet are usually more concerned about providing food and shelter for their children
               and that’s why this organization is working to take care of the little things along the way.Sometimes it’s giving a new trumpet
               to a struggling music student; other times, it’s buying new shoes for a young athlete living in poverty – or it’s simply providing 
               prom tickets, a bike lock, or new glasses to disadvantaged teenagers</p>
              
               <p>Regardless of the gift, the organization has found that fulfilling these small requests has a huge impact on the child’s self-esteem 
               and happiness. The organization was founded by Ron Fitzsimmons and his sister Laura in 2011 after they were motivated to start the nonprofit
               based on their own experiences growing up in a poor New York household during the 1960s. After their father left, their mother worked tirelessly
               to pay for food and rent – but they were still living paycheck to paycheck. Fitzsimmons told The Washington Post that he often skipped school because
               it was too “humiliating” to wear tattered clothing around his well-dressed peers. He and his sister now believe that their organization is helping other
               children to avoid that very same social anxiety.</p>
      
               <p>Alice’s Kids grants wishes based on the requests that are submitted to them by teachers, social workers, counselors, and homeless shelter staffers.
               The nonprofit then grants the wish by sending gift cards to the parents so they can purchase the gift themselves. Since the child is unaware of the 
               charitable exchange, parents are given an opportunity to feel supportive of their child’s additional needs – and the child may be given a chance to feel proud of their parent.
               “We’re not going to solve all the pains of all the children,” Ron told The Post. “But we just want to be part of the answer at least.”</p>
